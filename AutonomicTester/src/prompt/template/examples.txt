Example 1
Given the FUNCTION_CANDIDATE
public class Calculator {
    public int square(int number) {
        return number * number;
    }
}
and EXISTING_TEST_CASES
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;
public class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    public void testSquare() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(4, calculator.square(2)); // Test case with input 2
    }
}
and MONITORED_SCENARIO to test the square function with the input 5 together with the knowledge about TOPIC, TASK, QUESTIONS:
You should give me a response similar to:
{
    "Q1": {
        "question": "Is it redundant to create a test case using MONITORED_SCENARIO added to EXISTING_TEST_CASES?",
        "answer": "YES",
        "explanation": "The new input 5 is similar to an existing input 2 in the JUnit test because they are all common integers."
    },
    "Q2": {
        "question": "Does this MONITORED_SCENARIO cover new code fragments not tested in EXISTING_TEST_CASES?",
        "answer": "NO",
        "explanation": "The new input 5 does not introduce new code paths or require new environment conditions."
    },
    "Q3": {
        "question": "Given the previous questions, is there a risk of a runtime error/exception or unexpected behavior?",
        "answer": "NO",
        "explanation": "The execution should have a similar behaviour as already tested with the number 2."
    },
    "Q4": {
        "question": "Is the final result still correct with this MONITORED_SCENARIO respect to EXISTING_TEST_CASES?",
        "answer": "YES",
        "explanation": "The result should remain consistent by asserting calculator.square(5) equal to 25."
    }
