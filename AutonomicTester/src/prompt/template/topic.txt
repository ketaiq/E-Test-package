In this project, we define a new concept, i.e. autonomic testing, that relies on the observation that production failures are ignited by executing faulty elements in some software units with specific data and environment conditions. Such executions corrupt the state, resulting in error states that propagate through the system execution till a system failure in production. Faulty elements produce error states when executed with data and conditions that were not considered when testing in a development environment.
Expert testers only create test cases with essential differences to reduce testing overheads and save testing budgets. For string inputs, due to a myriad of combinations of characters, it is impossible to test all possibilities. Expert testers would only consider meaningful test cases with different characteristics, like simple numbers, long words, or random combinations of letters and special characters.
